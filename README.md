# PSO-implementations
## In this repository you can find my own implementations of Particle Swarm Optimization.

## Implementations list:

### PSO
- **the most basic version of PSO**

### PSO - inertia weight modifications
- **random inertia weight**
- **linear decreasing inertia weight**

### PSO - acceleration coefficients modifications
- **time linear coefficients**

### PSO - neighborhood topologies
- **Ring topology**
- **Von Neumann topology**

If you're unfamiliar with PSO, you can find information here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization

First paper about PSO here: https://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/~alceu/mestrado/aula3/PSO_2.pdf

I will try to each variant add links to papers that I based on.

I'm open to any questions or suggestions.

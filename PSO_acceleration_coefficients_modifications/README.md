# PSO - acceleration coefficients modifications

## PSO - time linear coefficients

### Information:
- inertia weight - constant
- c1 acceleration coefficient - linear (decreasing) 
- c2 acceleration coefficient - linear (increasing)
- topology - star
- using personal best position and global best position
- the initiated velocity is based on the initiated position
 
### Research papers:
 - **Self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with time-varying acceleration coefficients,** A. Ratnaweera, S. K. Halgamuge, and H. C. Watson, 2004

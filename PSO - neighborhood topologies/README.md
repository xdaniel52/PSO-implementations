# PSO - neighborhood topologies

## Ring topology

### Informations:
- inertia weight - constant
- c1 acceleration coefficient - constant
- c2 acceleration coefficient - constant
- topology - ring
- using personal best position and global best position
- the initiated velocity is based on the initiated position

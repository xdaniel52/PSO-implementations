# PSO - neighborhood topologies

## Ring topology

### Informations:
- inertia weight - constant
- c1 acceleration coefficient - constant
- c2 acceleration coefficient - constant
- topology - ring
- using personal best position and global best position
- the initiated velocity is based on the initiated position
 
### Research papers:
 - **Small worlds and mega-minds: Effects of neighborhood topology on particle swarm performance** J. Kennedy, 1999 
 - **The fully informed particle swarm: Simpler, maybe better** R. Mendes, J. Kennedy, and J. Neves, 2004
 
## Von Neumann topology

### Informations:
- inertia weight - constant
- c1 acceleration coefficient - constant
- c2 acceleration coefficient - constant
- topology - Von Neumann
- using personal best position and local best position
- the initiated velocity is based on the initiated position

# Test templates

## Particle generator and Particle Import
#### Enables you to generate sets of particles to have the same starting points for multiple algorithms. Also u can easy implement import of this particles.

## PSO Param Tuning
#### You can define some params value to test your PSO and script generates all combinations of your values, tests them and show you the best ones.

## PSO Self Param Tuning
#### It runs PSO inside another PSO to test it on chosen function. Inside PSO is visible for outher PSO as a normal function.

## PSO Test Variants
#### You can create multiple instances of PSO of any kind and test all of them on chosem functions.

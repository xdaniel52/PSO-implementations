# PSO - inertia weight modifications

## PSO - random inertia weight

### Information:
- inertia weight - random
- c1 acceleration coefficient - constant
- c2 acceleration coefficient - constant
- topology - star
- using personal best position and global best position
- the initiated velocity is based on the initiated position
 
### Research papers:
 - **A multi-information fusion ‘triple variables with iteration’ inertia weight PSO algorithm and its application** M. Li, H. Chen, X. Shi, S. Liu, M. Zhang, and S. Lu, 2019 
 
 
## PSO - linear decreasing inertia weight

### Information:
- inertia weight - linear decreasing
- c1 acceleration coefficient - constant
- c2 acceleration coefficient - constant
- topology - star
- using personal best position and global best position
- the initiated velocity is based on the initiated position
 
### Research papers:
 - **Empirical study of particle swarm optimization,**  Y. Shi and R. C. Eberhart 1999
